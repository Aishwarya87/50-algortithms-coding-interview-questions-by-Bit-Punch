We are looking for an increasing sequence followed by a decreasing sequence. Elements can not have the same values.
ALGORITHM:
 initialize a loop index starting from 1.
 this loop will go on till the current element is bigger than the previous element.
 the purpose of this loop is to find the index from which we should find the decreasing sequence.
 
 
 if i==1 after the loop, the loop doesnt have an increasing sequence
 if i==len(A), no decreasing sequence
 RETURN FALSE
