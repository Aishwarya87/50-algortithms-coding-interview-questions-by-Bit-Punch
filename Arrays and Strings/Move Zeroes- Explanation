In-place
ALGORITHM:

Instead of pushing the zeroes to the end of the array, why not move the non-zero elements to the beginning
(in the same order) and keep tarck of their count.

so, if there are total j non-zero elements, then 0's should start from index j.

define a pointer j at the beginning of the array, j=0

for each num in input:
  if num!=0:
    nums[j]=num
    j+=1
    
for every position x starting from j until input end; nums[x]=0

TIME COMPLEXITY: O(2*N)= O(N)
We do 2 separate loops over the input array.

SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(1)/ Constant Complexity
