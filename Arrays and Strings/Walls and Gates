'''Distant style question'''
Brute Force: repetitive work
Relationship between he INF(start point) and the Gate(end point) IS BIDIRECTIONAL.
Traverse from the gate to the inf;

Step1: Sequential search to find the gates. As soon as a gate is encountered, perform DFS(recursive function- pass the current step), from this value to the entire 2d array.
We do this for every value until we find a gate.
