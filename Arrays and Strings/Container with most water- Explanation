Real question: Find the maximum difference between x position multiplied by the height [RECTANGLE].

ALGORITHM:

Have two pointers at the ends of the array. 
l=0  r=len(input)-1
maxarea=0

while(l<r):  #stop when left pointer= right pointer
Maximize the area between our two buildings.

Decide what pointer should we move:
Area has to be maxiumum, so the pointer that points to lower height has to be moved with the hope 
of finding a larger height pointer.

Insight:  area=maximum;
          height= greater
          pointer(fix)= that is big
          
          calculating the area of the rectangle(container)where the water is enclosed.
          
          
Time complexity: O(N)/Linear we do a single pass over our container
Space Complexity: O(1):  didnt store anything that relates to the input size
