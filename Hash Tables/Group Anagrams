An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of a different word. such as: eat, tea, ate

Approach: append the string to the key of the sorted string in the hashmap.

Time complexity: O(N* M* LOG(M))
N= length of the input array

M= length of the biggest string in the array
Sorting algo:  M*LogM : since we sort each string when we pass over it in the loop.

Space Complexity: O(N): hashmap
