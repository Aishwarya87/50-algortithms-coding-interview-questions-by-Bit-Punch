Both static and dynamic arrays can increase their memory once it hits a certain limit and double-up the memory in another location. This has a performance implication.
Arrays have bad performance in operations like insert and delete that have to shift indexes over. 

Why Linked Lists:
These are scattered all over the memory like hash tables. Iterating through a linked list is a bit slower than iterating through an array.
Insertions are better than in arrays.
Their advantage over hash tables: These are ordered(sorted data).

Operations in a linked list:
prepend: O(1)
append: O(1)
lookup: O(n)
insert: O(n)
delete: O(n)

Pointers: a reference.
