Will m and n always be within the bounds of the linked list? YES
Can we receive m and n values for the whole linked list? Yes-->reverse the linked list

Writing out the test cases: only one listnode,m=1,n=1;;; None listnode, m=0,n=0
BEST CASE TEST CASE

Key: Have to change the pointers
keep the track of m-1 because that has to be pointed to the reversed linked list.
n+1 too

in the question, we get a head value.
 
the reversal question-i gave the head of the newly formed linkedlist. We have to have the track of the tail value as well here.
