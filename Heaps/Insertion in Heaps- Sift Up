In max heap:
Using Treenode
step1) insert(new value=x) at the next available spot.
step2) check if the max heap is valid. 
step3) compare x with its parent. If x is greater, swap with its parent. For every iteration, compare x itself.

Using BFS made Array
step1) "append" x
step2) compare against the parent value. keep comparing and swapping till the resting place has been found.
