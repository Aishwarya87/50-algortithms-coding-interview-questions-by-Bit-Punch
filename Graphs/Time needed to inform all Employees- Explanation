Graph questions are abstract. The question resembles a N-ary tree(graph like solution) like structure:
Any node can have any number of branches.

Verify the constraints:
Is this a Cyclic(reaching back the same node on traversal) Graph? Its guaranteed that the subordination relationships have a tree structure. Hence, no cycles
Is it circular if not cyclic? Can the employees have more than one manager
Is it Unconnected? Does every employee have a manager
Is this weighted?
Is this directed? Because it's a tree it must be directed

Test Cases:
heavily one sided binary tree.

Since there is no relationship among vertices of the same level and that of the vertices and subordinates that are not their own, for this reason there are limited
number of connections. Therefore we use a adjacency list.

Creation of an adjacency list
Using DFS. We want to explore a full branch first



class Solution:
    def numOfMinutes(self, n: int, headID: int, manager: List[int], informTime: List[int]) -> int:
        def dfs(currentID,adjList,informTime):
            if not adjList:
                return 0    #return 0 for the nodes that have no subordinates/children because that will take inform time=0
            maximum=0
            subordinates=adjList[currentID]
            for i in range(len(subordinates)):
                maximum=max(maximum,dfs(subordinates[i],adjList,informTime))
            return maximum+informTime[currentID]
        
        adjList=collections.defaultdict(list)
        for e in range(n):
            m=manager[e]
            if m==-1:
                continue #will skip the next statements and move on to the next value for e
            adjList[m].append(e) #[1:[0],2:[1]]
            
        return dfs(headID,adjList,informTime)
