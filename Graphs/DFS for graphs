The function is mostly recursive. This logic is going to repeat itself over and over again as far down one branch as it possibly can go.

difference between BFS and DFS:
1) in BFS,siblings are visited before the children and the vice versa for DFS.
2) BFS considers all neighbors first and not suitable fo decision making trees. From a conceptual standpoint, DFS is more suitable for puzzle problems because it makes a decision
and explores all the paths through this decision and stops if the decision leads to a win situation.

def traversalDFS(vertex, graph, values,seen):
  values.append(vertex)
  seen[vertex]=True
  connections=graph[vertex]
  for connection in connections:
    if connection not in seen:
      traversalDFS(connection,graph,values,seen)
