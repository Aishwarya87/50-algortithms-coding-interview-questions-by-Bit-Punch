This algorithm explores all the edges in a search for better path.

Step1) Have an array for nodes all assigned to infinity because we don't know what the distances are yet.
Step2) Start from the starting node.
Step3) Figure out the distance of every node connected DIRECTLY from the starting node. 
Step4) Make changes into the array accordingly/Update the value if the current evaluated value < value in the array.
Step5) Once done for the particular node[no direct edges remaining], close off/block that node(NEVER VISIT that node again).

Step6) start off with the node that has the smallest value in the array.[GREEDY DECISION MAKING]
Step7) repeat step 3,4,5 but with the new node.

Step8) Repeat for other nodes in this manner.
