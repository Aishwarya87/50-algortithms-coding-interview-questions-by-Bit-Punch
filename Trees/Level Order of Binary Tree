Level order: returning array of arrays
Verify the constraints:
Test Cases:
Heavily skewed : densed on one side.

Which traversal is better for this problem. 
BFS:  top down+left right pattern

BFS is an iterative solution

Modify the BFS algo.
 Steps:
 1) Identify levels of the tree
 2) initialize our array
 3) push the array into the resulting array.
